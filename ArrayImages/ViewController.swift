//  1. What happens when you get to the last element in the array? How would we correct this?
//  2. Based on what you have learned about random numbers, how can you iterate through the array randomly?

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
    // Declare an array which includes 13 elements (0-13)
    var cardArray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
    
    // This variable indicates the starting position within the array
    var position = 0
    
    // Outlet to access the properties of the UIImage object
    @IBOutlet weak var cardImageView: UIImageView!
    
    // Button action for the UIButton object. Everytime the button is clicked
    // the image is changed based on the value of the the position variable, which
    // is relative to the position of the image in the cardArray. The position
    // variable is then incremented by 1 (+=1)
    @IBAction func dealButtonAction(_ sender: Any) {

        cardImageView.image = UIImage(named: String(cardArray[position]))
        position += 1
    }
